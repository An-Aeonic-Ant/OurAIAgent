"Supreme Court Stays NCLAT Order Allowing NBCC To Take Over Stalled Housing Projects Of Supertech","22 Feb 2025 11:18 PM","Anmol Kaur Bawa","The Supreme Court on Friday (February 22) stayed the NCLAT order allowing National Building Constructions Corporation (India) Limited to take over pending projects of real-estate giant Supertech Limited. The Court also directed stakeholders to submit alternative proposals for the completion of projects. The bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justices Sanjay Kumar and KV Viswanathan was hearing a challenge to the order of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) which approved NBCC (India) Ltd.'s proposal to complete 16 incomplete projects of Supertech Limited. NBCC had filed an application to undertake the Projects of M/s. Supertech Limited (""Corporate Debtor""), in the pending insolvency proceedings by Union Bank of India, against M/s. Supertech Limited, a real-estate Company engaged in the construction of various housing Projects in Noida, Greater Noida, and other cities of the country. Notably, over 50,000 homebuyers have been waiting for possession of their homes, many of whom have faced financial hardships due to delays. The bench, while staying the operation of the impugned order, noted that the primary issue to be considered here was whether NCLAT handed over the projects to NBCC as per the procedure laid down under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016. The Court directed all the stakeholders such as the corporate guarantors, Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) and Corporate Debtor's promoter- RK Arora to submit any alternative proposals by March 21. Sr Advocates Shyam Divan and Dhruv Mehta appearing for the Corporate Guarantors mainly stressed that NCLAT did not provide a fair opportunity for others to submit their proposals. The secured creditors also submitted that NBCC's plan did not provide for any clarity on repaying dues. Counsels for YEIDA argued that the NCLAT directions were silent on the issue of repayment of pending dues to the landowning authorities.","https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/supreme-court-stays-nclat-order-allowing-nbcc-to-take-over-stalled-housing-projects-of-supertech-284736","https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/supreme-court-stays-nclat-order-allowing-nbcc-to-take-over-stalled-housing-projects-of-supertech-284736"

"Physical Presence Not Necessary In Domestic Violence Act Proceedings : Supreme Court Quashes Magistrate's Order To Extradite Husband From US","2025-02-22","Gyanvi Khanna","The Supreme Court (on February 20) observed that, in proceedings under the Domestic Violence, there is no requirement for a party to be personally present as such proceedings are quasi-criminal in nature. Elaborating, the Court said that such proceedings have no penal consequences except when there is a breach of a protection order, under Section 31 of the Act. In the present case, several proceedings were lodged against the appellant (husband) and the respondent (wife) against each other. As a result of such proceedings, the appellant's passport, who was residing in the USA, was impounded. In one such case of domestic violence filed by the respondent against the appellant, her mother-in-law and five other relatives, a notice was issued to the appellant. However, when the matter was listed again, as the appellant was not present, the court directed authorities to initiate the extradition process. When challenged, the High Court affirmed this order. Thus, the present appeal. At the very outset, the Court noted that the Trial Court had grossly erred in directing the physical presence of the appellant. ""We may observe that as the proceedings under the DV Act are quasi-criminal in nature, thus, there cannot be any justification to require the personal presence of the appellant in these proceedings."", the Bench of Justices Pankaj Mithal and Sandeep Mehta said. Apart from this, the Court also pointed out the appellant's inability to travel to India because of the impoundment of his passport. Taking a cue from this, the Court said: ""Consequently, the order of the learned JMFC directing the initiation of extradition proceedings against the appellant as a consequence of his non-appearance, despite being aware of the fact of impounding of the passport of the appellant, is untenable and unsustainable in the eyes of the law."" The Court also said that the High Court should have considered this and passed a reasoned order. Imperatively, the Court made another important observation that the impounding of the appellant's passport was ex-facie illegal. Referring to a landmark judgment in this regard, Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India and Anr., the Court said that the appellant was not given an opportunity to be heard. ""This clear violation of the principles of natural justice renders the act of impounding the passport ex-facie illegal. Consequently, we hold that the concerned authorities should release the appellant's passport within a period of one week from today.,"" the Court directed. It is pertinent to note that, during the proceedings, the appellants had also filed a petition, invoking the Court's inherent power, to seek dissolution of marriage on the grounds of irretrievable breakdown. To examine the same, the Court reproduced the factors discussed in Shilpa Sailesh v. Varun Sreenivasan and Kiran Jyot Maini v. Anish Pramod Patel, for determining irretrievable breakdown including the period of cohabitation after marriage; the gravity of allegations made by parties and impact on the personal relationship. Adverting to the facts of the case, the Court observed that the parties resided together for a short duration of 80 days in the USA and have been living separately ever since. Apart from this, multiple cases have been filed by them against each other, which include cases related to criminal cruelty, restitution of conjugal rights and domestic violence. In addition, the Court noted that attempts to resolve the dispute between the parties have been unsuccessful. ""The aforesaid facts give us the impression that there was hardly any cordiality or meaningful marital relationship that flowed from the marriage between the parties. It is evident that the relationship between the parties appears to be strained from the beginning and has further soured over the years.'' Based on this, the Court concluded that the present case is of irretrievable breakdown of marriage. As far as alimony is considered, the Court relied upon several cases including Parvin Kumar Jain v. Anju Jain, to highlight a list of factors while deciding the same. After scrutinising everything, the Court directed the appellant to pay Rs. 25 Lakhs as a one-time settlement for alimony. Thus, while quashing the impugned judgment, the Court also passed a direction that all the criminal cases and civil cases pending between the respondent and the appellant shall stand closed.

"Foreigners Tribunal Cannot Sit In Appeal Over Its Own Judgment & Reopen Concluded Issue Of Citizenship: Supreme Court","2025-02-22","Gursimran Kaur Bakshi","The Supreme Court recently held that a Foreigners Tribunal has no power to reopen a case by sitting in appeal over its own concluded judgment. The Court set aside an order of the Foreigners Tribunal which reopened an inquiry into the citizenship of a person, despite its earlier judgment which held the person to be an Indian citizen. As per brief facts, the Foreigners Tribunal passed an order on February 15, 2018, holding that the Appellant is not a foreigner who entered from Bangladesh on or after March 25, 1971. However, on December 24, 2019, the Tribunal entertained a fresh reference at the instance of the State of Assam. The Tribunal held that it was not divested of power to scrutinise the documents and materials and even findings in the earlier proceedings. Therefore, it directed the Appellant to file a written statement. Against this order, the Appellant filed a writ petition before the High Court. This was dismissed by upholding the power of the Tribunal to go into the question notwithstanding the earlier order. Against this, the present SLP was filed. A bench of Justices Abhay S. Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan noted that in the first order passed, the Assistant Government Advocate appeared for the State and the argument on behalf of it was heard. The Appellant also adduced the evidence. And it was after hearing arguments of the State, and after considering oral evidence and documents produced by her, that the Tribunal recorded a categorical finding in favour of the Appellant. However, the State did not challenge the first order by approaching the High Court. It also noted that the Counsel appearing for the State could not show under which provision the Tribunal entertained the review. The Supreme Court notes: 'In the second order dated 24th December, 2019, the Tribunal goes to the extent of holding that it is not divested with the power to scrutinize the documents and even findings in the earlier proceedings. The order indicates that the Tribunal wants to sit over in an appeal against it own concluded judgment and order. Such power can never be exercised by the Tribunal. The remedy of the State Government or for that matter the Central Government was to challenge the order dated 15th February, 2018. The High Court has missed the real issue. The real issue was whether the Tribunal could have reopened the case by recording a finding that it can scrutinize the findings recorded by the same Tribunal in earlier judgment which had become final. As the Tribunal was powerless to do it, only on that ground, we set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court as well as the impugned order dated 24th December, 2019 in F.T. Case No.2854/2012.' The Court also added that it is now not open for the State or Union to challenge the February 15 order. Case Details: REJIA KHATUN @ REZIA KHATUN v.

"Supreme Court To Recover Costs From Defence Colony RWA For Illegal Occupation Of Historic Monument For 60 Years","2025-02-22","Gursimran Kaur Bakshi","The Supreme Court recently directed the Department of Archaeology, Delhi to constitute a Committee within a week to initiate the process of restoration of Lodhi-era Shaikh Ali 'Gumti', a 500-year-old tomb of archaeological importance, which was under the illegal occupation of the Defence Colony Residents Welfare Association for 60 years. The Court also indicated its intention to recover the cost of illegal occupation from the DCRWA. Pursuant to an order dated January 21, the Defence Colony Residents Welfare Association, which has been illegally occupying the tomb for 60 years for the purpose of office, has now handed over its possession to the Land & Development Office, Ministry of Urban Affairs, Government of India, after removing its furniture and fixtures. The exercise of handing over the possession of the monument was done in the presence of a Senior Advocate and the Court-appointed Commissioner, Gopal Shankarnarayan. The Court has also asked the Residents Welfare Association to file a reply as to how much cost they should pay for unauthorised occupying the building for 60 years. They are required to file affidavit within 3 weeks. A bench of Justices Sudhanshu Dhulia and Ahsanuddin Amanullah was informed on February 18 by Shankarnarayan that an unauthorised parking area is being operated on the appurtenant land. It was informed that the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) gave the contract for parking. At present, the ongoing contract has expired. As a matter of caution, the Court directed that the contract for the parking shall not be renewed until further orders of the Court. Another parking is being operated by the MCD in the peripheral area. As per the Court, it has blocked access to the monument for the general public. The Court has directed the MCD to take every possible step to remove the parking as early as possible. It has also issued notice to the MCD to be present in the next hearing. The MCD shall apprise the Court as to what steps they propose to take to remove the encroachment. As per the report filed by the Department of Archeology, Delhi, based on the January 21 order, the Gumti is capable of being of conversation and restoration. The department has suggested the constitution of a Committee for this purpose. The Court has directed the department to constitute a Committee within a week and inform the Court of the progress in the next hearing on March 25. The Court noted that as per the Central Government's notification dated February 9, 2004, it recommended declaring Gumti as a monument of national importance under the Central legislation. However, this was objected to by the Residents Welfare Association. However, later in 2008, the Central Government decided not to declare it as a monument of national importance as major additions or alterations have been done by the Welfare Association leading to Gumti losing its originality. The Court ordered that the 2004 notification however should not come in a way in declaring the monument as a protected monument under the Delhi Ancient and Historial Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 2004, if deemed necessary.

"Know The Law | Distinction Between 'Equitable Mortgage' And 'Legal Mortgage' : Supreme Court Explains","22 Feb 2025","Yash Mittal","The Supreme Court recently explained the distinction between a legal mortgage and an equitable mortgage. The Court explained that a legal mortgage (in this case, mortgage by deposit of title deeds) is created when property rights are transferred to the mortgagee (lender), granting the mortgagee an enforceable right over the property in case of default. In contrast, an equitable mortgage is considered an incomplete mortgage, as it does not involve the transfer of property rights but is instead based solely on the parties' intention to create a mortgage.

"Supreme Court Imposes Costs On States & UTs For Failing To File Affidavit On Effective Implementation of Domestic Violence Act","22 Feb 2025 10:05 AM","Gursimran Kaur Bakshi","The Supreme Court on February 18 imposed a cost of Rs.5,000 on States of Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Odisha, Telangana, West Bengal, Assam and the Union Territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Lakshadweep for failing to file a status report on the effective implementation of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (PWDVA). The Court has now given 2 weeks of additional time with a payment to be deposited by each State the Supreme Court Mediation Centre. The order was passed in a PIL filed by We The Women of India', a non-governmental organisation. The suggestions filed by the petitioner are as follows: 1. Based on the population of each district and the average number of complaints/ inquiries related to domestic violence, a requisite number of protection officers holding independent charge (as per section 8 of the Act minimum one in each district) shall be appointed by the State Government/ UT. 2. The protection officers shall not only be given regular awareness training on various legal aspects related to domestic violence complaints/ inquiries they may receive but they shall also need to be sensitized to ably assist the aggrieved women. 3. The States/ UT shall be directed to have requisite number of shelter homes and medical facilities in each to assist the aggrieved women (s. 6 & 7). The 'One Stop Centers' being created/established under the 'Mission Shakti Project' may come handy and can be associated under the umbrella of the Act for the purpose of providing shelter but the restriction of providing stay only for 3/5 days needs to be done away. 4. A panel of lawyers of District and State Legal Service Authorities to provide free legal aid/ services to the aggrieved women shall made available with each protection officer and the concerned Magistrate Court/ Police Station. 5. In almost each of its affidavit the Union has referred to 'Mission Shakti' and 'One Stop Centers' in response to the specific issue of regular appointment of 'Protection Officers' holding independent charge, service providers, shelter homes, medical facilities, trained and sensitized police officers, etc. Petitioner's concern is for implementation of mandate of the Act. Mission Shakti/ One Stop Centers cannot replace/ supplant the mandatory provisions of the Act, they can though supplement the 'Assistance Network' conceptualized under the Act. Thus, a 'National Portal' may be created providing exhaustive details of the entire 'Assistance Network' fully functional with their addresses and contact details. 6. There should be a periodic review of functional status of the entire 'Assistance Network'. 7. There shall be a centralized scheme of allocation of funds for each State/UT dedicated to implementation and execution of the provisions of the Act including implementation of Section 11 of the Act in letter and spirit which means wide publicity of the provisions of the Act, awareness training and sensitization of all the stake holders be it judicial officers, police officers, protection officers, etc. 8. All the States/UTs may be directed to frame Recruitment Rules, create a separate Cadre structure for protection officers, and also to provide adequate office assistance to the Protection Officers. 9. A list of all the stakeholders of the 'Assistance Network' i.e. protection officers, service providers, shelter homes and medical facilities, shall be made available to each police station, if possible with a designated officer /desk to be attached with each Police station, area community centers, offices of local bodies, gram panchayat in villages and block level offices. For office all necessary paraphernalia assistance shall be provided to each Protection Officer and for spreading information (wide publicity) about the provisions of the Act, the Asha workers, anganwaadi workers, district legal service authorities and NGOs may all be collaborated. 10. There is not much data available and apparently no proper study is made so far about the number of distress calls or inquiry calls made on Women Helpline (181) or 100 number for help. Similarly, there is no exhaustive study/ data available district or state-wise about the complaints made under the DVA or the cases of Domestic Violence pending in the Courts. An empirical study throughout the States/ UTs shall be conducted by the Central Government to understand need of each district in terms of having minimum number of protection officers, shelter homes and medical facilities, etc. 11. The delay in disposal of DVA cases even at the stage of passing orders of interim maintenance is again a very concerning issue. A direction for time bound disposal of such cases would be very helpful especially for the interim maintenance orders to be passed.","https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/supreme-court-imposes-costs-on-states-uts-for-failing-to-file-affidavit-on-effective-implementation-of-domestic-violence-act-284678","https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/supreme-court-imposes-costs-on-states-uts-for-failing-to-file-affidavit-on-effective-implementation-of-domestic-violence-act-284678"
"Why 4.5 Years To Frame Rules? Supreme Court Questions Delay In Implementing 2020 Code On Rights Of Gig Workers","22 Feb 2025 9:30 AM","Gursimran Kaur Bakshi","The Supreme Court recently directed the Union to file an affidavit indicating the timeline in which the rules/scheme relevant to give effect to provisions of Chapter IX of the Code on Social Security, 2020, will be framed and given effect to. Chapter IX of the 2020 Code is specifically dedicated to rights and social security for unorganised workers, gig workers and platform workers. The Code received the assent of the President three years back in 2020. However, the relevant rules are yet to be framed. A bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Manmohan passed the order on February 18 in a writ petition filed by the 'Indian Federation of App-based Transport Workers' pertaining to the rights of gig workers. When the matter was taken up for hearing, Senior Advocate Dr. S. Muralidhar, for the petitioner, submitted that in the recent budget speech, a whole paragraph was devoted to the rights of gig workers. However, it is still unclear whether the Unorganised Workers' Social Security Act, 2008 will apply to them. Senior Advocate PS Patwalia(representing the parent company of Swiggy), argued that this is the first time the petitioner is arguing that it wants to be covered in the 2008 Act, whereas as per the petition, the argument was that the gig workers are covered in the 2020 Act. Dr. Muralidhar responded that the Code is yet to be enforced. To this, Patwalia stated that schemes under the 2020 Code are currently being implemented by the Labour Ministry in consultation with all stakeholders including the petitioner. When Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati stated that the rules are being formulated for the 2020 Code, Justice Datta asked: ""When can it be expected?…First pull up your socks."" Justice Manmohan said: ""Madam, only an astrologer can tell us when this new Code will come into force…Madam, are you willing to make a concession that they are covered even under 2008 Act?"" Bhati replied: ""Mylords, 2020 Code is what is going to cover them comprehensively. Chapter X…States and UTs have formulated their draft Rules. Put it up in public domain."" On this, Justice Datta questioned the delay of 3 years. He said: ""Madam, the President's assent was obtained on 29 September 2020. Four and a half years down the line…Why four and a half years to make the Rules?"" The Court will hear the matter after 2 weeks.","https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/why-45-years-to-frame-rules-supreme-court-questions-delay-in-implementing-2020-code-on-rights-of-gig-workers-284676","https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/why-45-years-to-frame-rules-supreme-court-questions-delay-in-implementing-2020-code-on-rights-of-gig-workers-284676"
"Supreme Court Seeks Reports From High Courts On Pendency Of Criminal Appeals","21 Feb 2025 9:44 PM","Amisha Shrivastava","The Supreme Court recently directed all High Courts to submit detailed reports on the pendency of criminal appeals, seeking comprehensive data on cases pending before Single Judges and Division Benches, including a bifurcation based on the bail status of the accused. A bench of Justice Abhay Oka and Justice Ujjal Bhuyan passed this order in a suo moto petition on policy strategy for grant of bail to convicts whose appeals are pending for a long time. In this case, the court is dealing with the issue of remission, bail, and delay in disposal of criminal appeals in High Courts. Recently, the Court passed comprehensive directions on remission of life convicts holding that states must consider premature release of eligible convicts even without their applications. ""The learned senior counsel appointed as Amicus Curiae has submitted a detailed note about the status of pendency of Criminal Appeals in the High Courts. Before we consider the note, we need to have a comprehensive data. We, therefore, direct the Registrar Generals of all the High Courts to submit a detailed report to this Court giving details of pendency of Criminal Appeals as under: 1) Number of appeals against conviction pending before the Single Judges and the Division Benches; 2) Further bifurcation of appeals against conviction into two categories (i) where accused have been granted bail and (ii) where accused have not been granted bail; and 3) The data regarding the appeals against acquittal pending before the Single Judges and the Division Benches"", the Court observed. The Supreme Court instructed the Registrar (Judicial) to immediately communicate the order to the Registrar Generals of all High Courts. The required data is to be submitted within one month. The Court scheduled the matter for further consideration on March 24, 2025. This order follows a detailed note submitted by Amici Curiae Liz Matthew and Gaurav Agrawal, which highlighted the pendency of 7,58,510 criminal appeals across 25 High Courts, as per data from National Judicial Data Grid. As per the note, the highest pendency was recorded in the Allahabad High Court with 2,33,909 cases, followed by the Madhya Pradesh High Court (1,15,357), Punjab and Haryana High Court (82,384), Rajasthan High Court (61,342), and Patna High Court (44,143). The lowest pendency was observed in the Tripura High Court, which had zero pending appeals. The note also provided an age-wise analysis of the pending appeals, revealing substantial delays in disposal. Recently, taking note of the high pendency of criminal matters in the High Courts, the Supreme Court had relaxed the conditions for the appointment of retired judges as ad-hoc judges at the High Courts. The Court has on many occasions sought data from various High Courts in order to address the pendency of appeals. The Supreme Court on March 31, 2017, in Ramu and Anr. v. State of Uttar Pradesh, directed the Registrar General of the Allahabad High Court to provide particulars of criminal appeals pending year-wise, disposal statistics of the last 10 years, and the causes for delays. The order also called for steps to accelerate disposals and a mechanism to oversee the process. On September 4, 2017, in Lawyers for Justice v. State of Madhya Pradesh and Anr., the Supreme Court ordered the Registrar General of the Madhya Pradesh High Court to provide details of criminal appeals, including the number of pending appeals, those involving life imprisonment, and the duration of pendency. In Krishnakant Tamrakar v. State of M.P., the Court suggested steps to address the pendency of criminal appeals. In Dayalu Kashyap v. State of Chhattisgarh, SLP (Crl.) 514/2021, the Supreme Court on October 6, 2021, directed the High Court Legal Services Committees to ensure that convicts represented by legal aid advocates do not face delays in the hearing of appeals. It also recommended that convicts who had served more than half the sentence for fixed-term sentences or eight years for life sentences should be considered for bail. The Court suggested exploring the possibility of disposal of appeals on the basis of the sentence undergone, with a similar exercise recommended for life sentence cases where remission was possible. On February 9, 2022, in Sonadhar v. State of Chhattisgarh, the Supreme Court adopted the directions from Dayalu Kashyap and further considered releasing individuals who had either served half the sentence or were in custody for half the sentence during the trial. This was aimed at allowing the judicial system to focus on more serious cases. Thereafter, in Suleman v. State of Uttar Pradesh, the Court on March 25, 2022, called for a report from the Registrar of the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court on the availability of criminal benches. On May 9, 2022, the Court expressed concern over long pendency and directed the State Government to take a stand on appeals pending for over 10 years. It recommended considering bail for convicts in single-offence cases pending for more than 10 years and the remission of sentences for those meeting the norms, irrespective of the pendency of appeals.","https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/supreme-court-seeks-reports-from-high-courts-on-pendency-of-criminal-appeals-284674","https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/supreme-court-seeks-reports-from-high-courts-on-pendency-of-criminal-appeals-284674"
